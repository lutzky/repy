# repy-go

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lutzky/repy-go.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lutzky/repy-go)

This is a parsing library for Technion REPY files, written in Go. The intent is
to provide better-tested and more robust code, focused entirely on parsing the
REPY file, and providing it in a usable format for other software, replacing
the aging [ttime](http://lutzky.github.io/ttime).
